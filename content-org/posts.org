Trying to use [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] to have sort of a [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tumblelog][tumblelog]] with [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]].

What's a tumblelog? Just kind of a stream-of-consciousness blog. Might have recurring topics. Might not. Posts might have titles. They might not. Might be short notes. Might be long essays.

Why? Inspired by the [[https://rachel.live][Rachel Quickblogge]]. Course she did hers the smart and quick way, using WordPress. But I gotta be me, and [[https://www.oglaf.com/trapmaster/][overthinking]] it is what I do best.

Looks nice, yes? Starting with the familiar [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hyde/][Hyde]] theme. Going on vacation now, so it may take me a few days to turn this project into a proper mess.

Note added with a capture template, though I still need to manually assemble a bit.

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("t" "Tumblelog" entry
           (file+olp+datetree bmw/tumble-log)
           "* %U %?\n:properties:\n:export_file_name: nnn.md\n:end:\n")
          ))
#+end_src

Less manual construction than a couple minutes ago!

I'll have to learn some Elisp to make it work how it does in my head.

So what's the plan?

- use Org mode for authoring and organizing on my side of things
- take advantage of [[https://netlify.com][Netlify]] features where possible
- loads of [[https://indieweb.org][IndieWeb]] of course

ox-hugo and Hugo were the easiest to start with on this idea, but I may end up somewhere else. [[https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/][Elder.js]] and [[https://orga.js.org][Orga]] could lead me down another path, for example.

Meanwhile, getting updates that our critters are being properly cared for while we're on vacation, so I can do very important things like take pictures of shoes.

Sure would love to figure out [[https://beorg.app][beorg]] configuration enough to make it part of my posting workflow here.

Well I sure won't be learning all of it during this trip. /Maybe/ after I get home --- though the priority drops significantly when I'm in front of my home system.

Eight hours of sleep. Such a miracle! Course I think I mentioned we're staying right in the [[https://vegasexperience.com][Fremont Experience]], so that required waiting until around 2am to fall asleep.

I'm having some fun despite myself, but I am also very much looking forward to getting home.

My only /intentional/ use of Emacs at the moment is assorted [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] tools, but even at that level it'd sure help to get more comfortable with it.

Also it's after 1am here and I should go to bed. Just wanted to read that tab before I closed it, and now I'm all "ooh that sounds good."

Oh, and I'm working up yet another Emacs config reset, to simplify the learning process while reading [[https://www.masteringemacs.org][Mastering Emacs]]. Using [[https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults][better-defaults]] as the core.

#+hugo: more

Much more modest than my [[https://randomgeekery.org/config/emacs/nano/][nano-based]] config. For now, at least. I'll add it to my config pages eventually. First I need to catch up with work stuff.

Probably something to do with a quarter century of muscle memory and deep embedding of a particular tool's quirks, but I'm having trouble sticking to Emacs over (neo)vim even for small stuff like this tumblelog.

Looking at [[https://nvim-orgmode.github.io][nvim-orgmode]] and even [[https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg][Neorg]] --- though Neorg's [[https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/blob/main/docs/NFF-0.1-spec.md#detached-modifiers-and-their-functions][spec]] limit of six levels of header really chafes at my heavily outliner-oriented style. If I accept arbitrary constraints like that, then I may as well use Markdown or Asciidoctor. At least those have familiar syntax.

For today? Emacs may not be comfortable, but it's the native home for Org files and that'll do.

Last night I ran a clean install of [[https://pop.system76.com][Pop!_OS]] 22.04 on the Linux partition. All seemed well, until I noticed that no Electron-based apps had titlebars. Also? Unless I'm in tiling mode, they're all stacked in one unreachable, unresizable mass in the middle.

No screenshot, sorry. Had to get stuff done so I'm regrouping in the Windows partition. I'll ponder what to do about it later. Might overlay the whole thing with [[http://regolith-desktop.com][Regolith Desktop]] until I get a better plan. Regretting that I replaced a perfectly functional [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith 1.6]] install for this.

Seeing if I set up =ox-hugo= [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/][auto-export]] correctly. Yep, though it didn't apply until I reverted / reloaded this Org buffer.

=SITE/.dir-locals.el= looks like this:

#+begin_src elisp
  (("content-org/"
    . ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))))

Just a really mild adjustment to the [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#org_002droam_002ddailies][org-roam-dailies]] "sane default configuration." Main difference is an inactive timestamp like I have for the tumblelog --- I like having a chronology --- and some file tags.

I may go past this with specific templates for tasks and bookmarks. But first I need to make sure this basic setup works for me.
