Trying to use [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] to have sort of a [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tumblelog][tumblelog]] with [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]].

What's a tumblelog? Just kind of a stream-of-consciousness blog. Might have recurring topics. Might not. Posts might have titles. They might not. Might be short notes. Might be long essays.

Why? Inspired by the [[https://rachel.live][Rachel Quickblogge]]. Course she did hers the smart and quick way, using WordPress. But I gotta be me, and [[https://www.oglaf.com/trapmaster/][overthinking]] it is what I do best.

Looks nice, yes? Starting with the familiar [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hyde/][Hyde]] theme. Going on vacation now, so it may take me a few days to turn this project into a proper mess.

Gotta wait for nameserver stuff to propogate. Patience is not consistently one of my virtues.

Note added with a capture template, though I still need to manually assemble a bit.

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("t" "Tumblelog" entry
           (file+olp+datetree bmw/tumble-log)
           "* %U %?\n:properties:\n:export_file_name: nnn.md\n:end:\n")
          ))
#+end_src

Less manual construction than a couple minutes ago!

I'll have to learn some Elisp to make it work how it does in my head.

So what's the plan?

- use Org mode for authoring and organizing on my side of things
- take advantage of [[https://netlify.com][Netlify]] features where possible
- loads of [[https://indieweb.org][IndieWeb]] of course

ox-hugo and Hugo were the easiest to start with on this idea, but I may end up somewhere else. [[https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/][Elder.js]] and [[https://orga.js.org][Orga]] could lead me down another path, for example.

Oh hey DNS has propagated. So this thing has a proper URL now: https://randomgeekery.life.

Meanwhile, getting updates that our critters are being properly cared for while we're on vacation, so I can do very important things like take pictures of shoes.

Sure would love to figure out [[https://beorg.app][beorg]] configuration enough to make it part of my posting workflow here.

Well I sure won't be learning all of it during this trip. /Maybe/ after I get home --- though the priority drops significantly when I'm in front of my home system.
