Trying to use [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] to have sort of a [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tumblelog][tumblelog]] with [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]].

What's a tumblelog? Just kind of a stream-of-consciousness blog. Might have recurring topics. Might not. Posts might have titles. They might not. Might be short notes. Might be long essays.

Why? Inspired by the [[https://rachel.live][Rachel Quickblogge]]. Course she did hers the smart and quick way, using WordPress. But I gotta be me, and [[https://www.oglaf.com/trapmaster/][overthinking]] it is what I do best.

Looks nice, yes? Starting with the familiar [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hyde/][Hyde]] theme. Going on vacation now, so it may take me a few days to turn this project into a proper mess.
