Started playing with local =custom.css= to tweak the [[https://github.com/sokirill/logseq-panic-theme][Panic]] theme for [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]].

#+caption: Some of those jots go back to Logseq 0.1.x, so don't trust them.

I changed the default text font to [[https://opendyslexic.org][OpenDyslexic]] and code to the [[https://www.nerdfonts.com][Nerd Fonts]] version of [[https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans][Fantasque Sans Mono]]. No I'm not dyslexic --- at least I'm pretty sure I'm not --- but I find these friendlier and easier to read than the more severe fonts in common use. I usually install them locally on whatever device I use for ready access.

#+BEGIN_SRC css
:root {
  --ls-font-family: "OpenDyslexic";
  --ls-page-text-size: 18px;
}

.extensions__code .CodeMirror {
  font-family: "FantasqueSansMono NF", monospace;
}

.content :not(pre) > code {
    font-family: "FantasqueSansMono NF", monospace;
}
#+END_SRC

Now I want to go all in and make a proper theme.
