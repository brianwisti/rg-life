Having put about 150 hours combined into American / European [[https://worldoftrucks.com/en/profile/6779015][Truck Simulator]] --- for me, a very long time paying attention to the same topic --- this review by [[https://www.escapistmagazine.com/category/zero-punctuation/][Yahtzee]] describing [[https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/hardspace-shipbreaker][Hardspace: Shipbreaker]] as a "Dad game" makes it sound possibly relevant to my interests.
