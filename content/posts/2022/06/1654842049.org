[[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] is great. Native outlining, org-like tasks, the power of [[http://www.learndatalogtoday.org][Datalog]]. But Obsidian has the [[https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/][Dataview]] plugin. What you feed it looks a lot like SQL.

#+begin_src dataview
TABLE
  length(rows) as "Notes"
from ""
where isa != null
GROUP BY isa
SORT isa ASC
#+end_src

I kinda know SQL already. Enough to know what to look up to make a table of note types.

| Group       | Notes |
|-------------+-------|
| Book        |     3 |
| Game        |     5 |
| Meeting     |     1 |
| Movie       |     1 |
| Package     |     1 |
| Person      |    41 |
| Pet         |     4 |
| Project     |     1 |
| Source Note |    16 |

Nope. Haven't settled on One True Note System and I likely never will. But at least I'm enjoying myself.
