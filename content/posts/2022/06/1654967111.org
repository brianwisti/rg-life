Got Org Babel playing nice with TypeScript thanks to [[https://github.com/lurdan/ob-typescript][ob-typescript]]. It's a wild Saturday morning here.

That required a few more lines in my config, but not /too/ many.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package ob-typescript)
(use-package org
  ;; ...
  :config
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    '((typescript . t))))
#+end_src

I also followed my own [[{{< ref "posts/2022/05/1652421774.md" >}}][advice]] and added [[https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide][Tide]] for TypeScript support in Emacs. Just copied and pasted from all the links, so config's a bit of a mess.

Oh hey that's right I still need to take my ADHD meds. I'll go do that now.
