I'm not dead yet! Site wasn't updating because Netlify failed with an =exit code 2=. Bit vague. Finally had a few minutes to look closer.

Turns out it's because I've been keeping up locally with Hugo releases and syntax changes, but not telling Netlify. They need the same version of Hugo that I use.

So now I've got a basic `netlify.toml` based on [[https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/hugo/][Netlify Hugo docs]].

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[build]
  command = "hugo"
  publish = "public"

[build.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.101.0"
#+END_SRC

Looks like everything is good again.
