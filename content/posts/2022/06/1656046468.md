Thinking hard about whether to keep splitting my attention between multiple
sites.

Sure, it's only two. But I consolidated everything to [Random Geekery][rgb]
several years back for a reason: if I have more than one site, at least one

Not taking any hard action at the moment. I'm just gonna keep pondering for
a bit.
