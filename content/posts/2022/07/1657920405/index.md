This week the Linux partition is [EndeavourOS][endeavour-os] â€” specifically
[Qtile Community Edition][qtile-edition].

So far, I like it.

And yeah, I think I still want the tumblelog for sharing quick links and what
not. I'll tie it in a bit more closely with the [main blog][rgb-blog], but I
will let it live as its own separate site.
