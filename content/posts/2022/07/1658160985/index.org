Cats haven't checked in on me for a bit. It's nice. A bit creepy, but nice.

Oh and for a little bit of [[https://nushell.sh][Nushell]] geekery — don't let the =bsh= in the terminal prompt fool you; that's for work — here's how I copied the newest photo from Dropbox sync to the folder for this post — since neither are named in a readily accessible pattern for quick typing:

#+begin_src nushell
cp (ls ~/Dropbox/Camera | last | get name) $"(ls content/posts/2022/07/ | last | get name)/cats.jpg"
#+end_src
