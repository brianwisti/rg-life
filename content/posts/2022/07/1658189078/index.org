Figured out how to do [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets][text snippets]] in Visual Studio Code for [[https://www.dendron.so][Dendron]] notes. My wish for this world is less JSON.

<!--more-->

Would YAML be better? Maybe, but no. I'm thinking something more like Emacs [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]] files. Sure a file for every snippet may sound like overkill. It's a heck of a lot easier to figure out what a single template looks without filtering from JSON list and then translating from JSON string to template string.

Anyways, snippets for timestamped list items in Dendron.

#+begin_src json
{
    "itime": {
        "prefix": "itime",
        "scope": "markdown",
        "body": "- **$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:** ",
        "description": "timestamp for interstitial notes"
    },
    "inow": {
        "prefix": "inow",
        "scope": "markdown",
        "body": "- **$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE $CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:** ",
        "description": "datetime for interstitial notes"
    }
}
#+end_src

Handy for [[https://betterhumans.pub/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef][interstitial journaling]]. Take the claims about interstitial journaling with as much salt as you need. I use timestamped notes to remember when I did, said, or thought a thing.

For some of us "time tracking" is just a tool to — um — track time.
