Continuing to get annoyed at Datalog for [[https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/advanced%20queries][queries]] in Logseq, when I remembered [[https://www.orgroam.com][org-roam]] uses a SQLite database. Plus there's [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]], which â€” sheesh. It's impressive.
