I tried visually replacing a few [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] tags with icons in CSS. It worked!

How'd I do it? Here I'll just paste from my journal note figuring out the first
one. I'm sure I'll revisit this tonight after taking care of the day's
business.

- #idea Thinking about custom tag icons for logseq
	- #warning under construction #warning
	- Inspired by Obsidian [[https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/CSS+Snippets/Alternate+Checkboxes+(SlRvb)][Alternate Checkboxes]] CSS snippet
	- Here's what =#idea= looks like in the dev console:
		- #+begin_src html
		  <div
		       class=""
		       style="display: inline;"
		       data-tooltipped=""
		       aria-describedby="tippy-tooltip-119"
		       data-original-title="null"
		       ><a
		           data-ref="idea"
		           class="tag">#idea</a></div>
		  #+end_src
	- #question how do my installed plugins change the structure?
		- I don't think I currently have any plugins that alter element attributes
	- Set up [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors][CSS Selector]] #bookmark to match
		- =a.tag[data-ref="idea"]=
	- Hide the displayed tag by making it tiny
		- #+begin_src css
		  a.tag[data-ref="idea"] {
		    border: none;
		    font-size: 0;
		  }
		  #+end_src
	- Append an icon with the font size we started at
		- #+begin_src css
		  a.tag[data-ref="idea"]:after {
		    content: "ðŸ’¡";
		    font-size: initial;
		  }
		  #+end_src
	- as-is, this has accessibility issues and =font-size: initial= won't work with headings. Also, to do it right I should be encoding the icon
