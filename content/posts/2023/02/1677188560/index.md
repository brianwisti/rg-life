Been getting deeper into [SiYuan Note][siyuan] lately.
It's neat, and offers synchronization through Amazon S3 or any compatible service.
Compatible?
Well heck.
Didn't know that there's something out there S3 enough without being S3.

Using Digital Ocean [Spaces][do-spaces] for the last month or two.
Now I want to try self-hosted.
Hopefully I can set up [Garage][garage] on my Raspberry Pi 4.
